# PPO-Agent-on-LunarLander-v3-
### Reinforcement Learning Project – Training &amp; Demonstration

This project showcases a **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** agent trained to solve the **LunarLander-v3** environment from the Box2D family (Gymnasium).

The repository demonstrates:
-  **A trained agent performing inference**
-  **Training performance curves**
-  **A short video of the final agent**  🎥 
-  **High-level explanation of PPO**

⚠️ **Note:**  
The full training code will be uploaded **after the course evaluation period ends** to respect academic integrity requirements.
